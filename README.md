# CIS 3920 Final Project

## This machine learning project was completed with a team of students from my Data Mining for Business Analytics class. The goal of our project was to determine whether it is profitable to make a movie, given our knowledge of the budget, genre, runtime, and MPAA rating. Since our target audience consists of movie producers and directors, our findings will be beneficial to determine whether or not they should move forward with making a movie.
