# CIS 3920 Final Project

## Credits to the other members of Team DSAS from Baruch College!

### This machine learning project was completed with a team of students from my Data Mining for Business Analytics class. The goal of our project was to determine whether it is profitable to make a movie, given our knowledge of the budget, genre, runtime, and MPAA rating. Since our target audience consists of movie producers and directors, our findings will be beneficial to determine whether or not they should move forward with making a movie. 

### Since we are trying to predict a numeric value (gross revenue), we used three models: multiple linear regression, KNN, and random forest. 

### In the context of the business problem, our model did not perform well. Our RMSE values for both the baseline and complex model were high. While we got an RMSE of nearly $49 million for our baseline method, our complex method gave us RMSE values around $23 million. In both models, it is very risky for a prospective producer to invest.  Given the current circumstances, a producer would not find this model to be useful in predicting their revenue. We also made some interesting findings from our observation of the two Kaggle datasets. For example, there are a lot of movies produced with small budgets. There was one movie with a budget of $300. It is interesting to think how this movie was even made. Also, we saw that the maximum runtime in our original dataset exceeded four hours. We would be interested in knowing if the movie viewers even attentively watch this movie. In conclusion, although our RMSE value was higher than expected, we were glad that our complex model performed better, just by adding one variable and restricting data range. If given more time, we would love to obtain more data, especially from movies released this past year and seeing how they would perform.

#### Paper to be published soon on findings.
